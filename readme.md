
## **Macroeconomics Analytics**
This project focuses on analyzing macroeconomic data, specifically GDP, unemployment rates, and inflation. I used publicly available data from the World Bank to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), simulation, and machine learning tasks to gain insights into economic trends.

## **Data Pre-processing**
 - The initial data cleaning and transformation involved the following steps:
 - Cleaning: Removed irrelevant columns, handled NaN values, and merged data from different sources into a unified dataset.
 - Data Conversion: Converted values into more readable formats, ensuring consistency across all datasets.
 - Reshaping Data: Used melting to transform dataframes from wide format to long format for easier analysis.
 - Merging Data: Consolidated all individual datasets (GDP, unemployment, inflation) into a single, easy-to-access dataframe for further analysis.

## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
    - Phillips Curve: Analyzed the relationship between unemployment and inflation in Canada and Italy, exploring the trade-off and historical trends.Ã¹
    - Monte Carlo Simulation: Used the Monte Carlo method to simulate and predict GDP growth, factoring in randomness to model future economic scenarios.
    - Machine Learning: Applied a Random Forest Classifier to predict years of economic recession based on historical data of GDP, unemployment, and inflation.

## **Technologies Used**
    - **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Numpy**, **Scikit-learn**.
