Hi! This is a macroeconomics data analytics. I downloaded GDP, unemployment ratio and inflation csv data from Data World Bank.

Pre-analytics steps:
  - First cleaning: Drop useless columns, remove NaN, intersection between dataframe
  - Data conversion to more readable values.
  - Melting to transform dataframes from wide to long format.
  - Merge all dataframes to consolidate the data into a single and easy accessible dataframe

Python EDA
  - Phillip's Curve and evaluation on canada and Italy
  - Impact of 2008 crisis on GDP and Unemployment, with correlation

Visualization on Tableau as a interactive dashboard:
  - Phillip's Curve scatterplot (inflation and unemployment)
  - GDP and Unemployment per Year for every Country
  - Inflation world map
  - GDP tree map
  - Year filter to visualize data
