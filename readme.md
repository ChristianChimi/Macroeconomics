## **Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing macroeconomic data, specifically GDP, unemployment rates, and inflation. I used publicly available data from the World Bank to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), simulation, and machine learning tasks to gain insights into economic trends.

## **Data Pre-processing**
     - The initial data cleaning and transformation involved the following steps:
     - Cleaning: Removed irrelevant columns, handled NaN values, and merged data from different sources into a unified dataset.
     - Data Conversion: Converted values into more readable formats, ensuring consistency across all datasets.
     - Reshaping Data: Used melting to transform dataframes from wide format to long format for easier analysis.
     - Merging Data: Consolidated all individual datasets (GDP, unemployment, inflation) into a single, easy-to-access dataframe for further analysis.

## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
    - Phillips Curve: Analyzed the relationship between unemployment and inflation in Canada and Italy, exploring the trade-off and historical trends.Ã¹
    - Monte Carlo Simulation: Used the Monte Carlo method to simulate and predict GDP growth, factoring in randomness to model future economic scenarios.
    - Machine Learning: Applied a Random Forest Classifier to predict years of economic recession based on historical data of GDP, unemployment, and inflation.

## **Key Insights**
     - Phillips Curve Analysis: The analysis of the Phillips Curve in Canada and Italy revealed the historical trade-off between unemployment and inflation, helping to understand how these two macroeconomic indicators interact over time.
     - GDP Growth Simulation: The Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated the potential future scenarios of GDP growth, incorporating randomness to account for uncertainties in economic forecasting. This highlights the importance of considering various factors when predicting economic outcomes.
     - Recession Prediction: The application of the Random Forest Classifier allowed for the identification of years of economic recession, based on historical data of GDP, unemployment, and inflation. This model can potentially be used to predict future recessions by analyzing similar economic patterns.

## **Conclusions**
This project provided valuable insights into macroeconomic trends, utilizing tools like Python for data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and machine learning techniques. The Phillips Curve analysis enhanced the understanding of the relationship between unemployment and inflation, while the Monte Carlo simulation offered a probabilistic view of future GDP growth, allowing for more informed economic planning. Additionally, the Random Forest model provided a data-driven approach to predicting economic recessions, demonstrating the potential of machine learning in economic forecasting. Overall, this analysis can serve as a useful resource for policymakers and economists to better understand and predict macroeconomic trends, supporting strategic decision-making for economic stability.
